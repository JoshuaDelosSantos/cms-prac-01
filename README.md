# Startup

## Name
AtomBridge

## Problem
The inefficiency, cost, and environmental impact of current modes of transportation (planes, trains, and automobiles). Long-distance travel is time-consuming and resource-heavy.

## Solution
Teleportation through molecular disassembly and reassembly. By standing in the AtomBridge Podâ„¢, users can seamlessly and instantly travel anywhere that has a receiving pod. Atoms from your body are scanned, digitized, sent as information to the destination, and reassembled precisely as before, down to the molecular level.

## How it works
1.	Atomization: The pod scans and converts your body into an atomic blueprint.
2.	Information Transmission: This blueprint is transmitted via a secure quantum network to the destination pod.
3.	Reconstruction: Atoms at the destination pod are reorganized to create an exact replica of you.
